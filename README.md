# remote-control

This is a remote control project written in Swift for a course from graduate school. The application is interactive and allows the user to press multiple buttons. The first screen will show a typical TV remote control with a display summary at the top of the screen. The second screen will direct user to the DVR remote control with a display summary at the top of the screen. The last screen will display favorite channel configuration.
